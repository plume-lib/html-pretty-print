# html-pretty-print #

Pretty-prints an HTML file, after converting it to valid XML. To use:

```java plume.HtmlPrettyPrint file.html > filepp.html```

Note: HTML is not necessarily required to be valid XML.
Therefore, this program may make more fixes than are necessary
to make the HTML file a valid HTML file.
However, this program's main purpose is pretty-printing.
